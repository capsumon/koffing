# Koffing

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/koffing.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/koffing)
![Build Status](https://github.com/itsjavi/koffing/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)

Koffing is a Pokemon Showdown importable-syntax parser for JavaScript and TypeScript.

[Pokémon Showdown](https://www.pokemonshowdown.com/) is the most popular online Pokémon battle simulator,
one of the best ways to quickly try your strategies for the official Pokémon VGC Championships. This library is just
a parser for the teams generated by the [Showdown Team Builder](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder) exports.

This repository holds the source code for the library as well as the code for the Online Parser.
The [Online Parser](https://itsjavi.github.io/koffing) does not require you to download
any library or script, it is recommended if all you want is to sanitize, prettify or convert to JSON your
Showdown team exports.

## Features

- Compatible with Gen 9 Pokémon definitions
- Compatible with web browsers, ES6+, TypeScript and NodeJS
- Converts from Showdown code to JSON and vice-versa
- Sanitizes Showdown code (removing invalid data, applying max and mins values, etc.)
- Prettifies Showdown code (proper indentation, line breaks and sorting of the data, etc.)
- [Online Parser](https://itsjavi.github.io/koffing), which is using the library
  featuring all the above mentioned.

## Installation

As a package:

```bash
npm i koffing

# or

yarn add koffing
```

In the browser, using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/itsjavi/koffing/0.6.0/dist/koffing.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Javascript (ES5, web)

```html
<script src="dist/koffing.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var teamCode = `=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===`
  var parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode)
  console.log(parsedTeam)

  // Note that the ShowdownParser class, which is used internally by the Koffing class
  // is also exposed in the global scope:
  console.log(new ShowdownParser(teamCode).parse())
</script>
```

### Javascript (ES6+, universal)

```js
'use strict'

import { Koffing } from 'koffing'

const teamCode = `
=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===

let parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode)

// This will log a PokémonTeamSet object:
console.log(parsedTeam)
// Convert it back to the Showdown format (prettified):
console.log(parsedTeam.toShowdown())
// which is the same as:
console.log(parsedTeam.toString())
// and the same as:
console.log(parsedTeam + '')
// You can also convert the object to JSON:
console.log(parsedTeam.toJson())
// which is the same as:
console.log(Koffing.toJson(teamCode))
```

### NodeJS

```js
const Koffing = require('koffing').Koffing

const teamCode = `=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===`
let parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode)
console.log(parsedTeam)
```

## Class Reference

The `Koffing` class is basically a wrapper of the `ShowdownParser` class, the difference is that it can be used statically.

`ShowdownParser` class methods:

- `parse(): PokemonTeamSet`: Parses the Showdown code and returns a `PokemonTeamSet` object.
- `format(): String`: Parses the Showdown code and returns a prettified and sanitized version of it.
- `toString(): String`: Basically returns the internal Showdown code string as it is.

`Koffing` class methods:

- `static parse(showdownCode): PokemonTeamSet`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse()`
- `static format(showdownCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.format()`
- `static toJson(showdownCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse().toJson()`
- `static toShowdown(jsonCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse().toShowdown()`
